<h1>What i'm planning to make? and how </h1>
<p> I'm trying to make a Linux version of WhatsApp since there isn't any official version of WhatsApp for Linux, I mean, there might be some third-party program like the one i'm making, but who cares? Can't I make my own? lmao hehe      </p>
<p> I'm planning to let users receive message without the need of WhatsApp web why you may ask tbh, i'm lazy af and I don't want to open that shity browser every time just to check my empty chat. So, how do I plan on making this?
TBH idk
  <h2> Here's a rough route map on how I will make </h2>
  <p>I'll create a script using a headless browser, probably puppet, that will check WhatsApp web every interval(5-10 seconds) if there are any new messages (new element) then it will generate a notification on my Linux, and this script will start automatically every time I turn on my device</p>
  

    
  <p>This is my thinking T_T IDK if it will work or not. Till now, I just managed to get the list of all the chats that are available in a user's phone T_T </p>
