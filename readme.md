<h1>What i'm planing to make? and how </h1>
<p> I'm trying to make a linux version of whatsapp since there isn't any official version of whatsapp for linix, I mean there might be some third party program like the one i'm making but who cares? can't i make my own? lmao hehe      </p>
<p> I'm planing to let users recieve message without the need of whatsapp web why you may ask tbh i'm lazy af and i don't want to open that shity browser everytime just to check my emty chat. So hwo do i plan on making this?
TBH idk
  <h2> Here's a rough route map on how will i make </h2>
  <p>I'll create a script using a headless browser probably puppet that will check whatsapp web every interval(5-10sec) if there are any new message(new element) then it will generate a notification on my linux,and This script will start automatically every time i turn on my device</p>
  

    
  <p>This is my thinking T_T IDK it will work or not till now i just managed to get the list of all the chat that are available in a users phone T_T </p>
